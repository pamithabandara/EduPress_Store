üìò EduPress Store is an all-in-one campus solution combining a stationery e-commerce system with a smart print-on-demand service‚Äîeliminating long queues and guesswork at university print shops. Designed for students, the platform allows users to easily browse and purchase supplies, upload print documents (PDF/DOCX), select between colour or black-and-white printing, view real-time pricing, pay online, and simply pick up once their order is marked ‚Äúready‚Äù.

Built on the XAMPP stack (Apache, PHP, MySQL), the system runs entirely offline/local for quick deployment. The front end is built with lightweight HTML/CSS/PHP, while vanilla JavaScript powers dynamic functionality like price previews, upload validation, and cart updates‚Äîensuring optimal speed without extra dependencies.

On the backend, the data model uses five normalized InnoDB tables (users, products, print_jobs, orders, order_items) to efficiently handle user data, inventory, and hybrid carts combining stationery and print jobs. Secure practices like password hashing are implemented to safeguard user credentials.
